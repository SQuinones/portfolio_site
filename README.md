During the TTP program portfolio website I build many front end projects. In my portfolio I include five of them. I am so gratefull to be part of this program since I develop many important skills for a full stack web development. This programs also help me to build a strong passion for programming specially for front end development. My portfolio is in progress work I will intend to add much features and style.
